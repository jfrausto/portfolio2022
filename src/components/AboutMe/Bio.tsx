        Welcome! Iâ€™m from East Los Angeles, California and I love coding, creating, and exploring the web. 
        I have a passion for building intuitive applications that are useful and fun to navigate. 
        I enjoy using technology such as JavaScript, React, and NodeJs
        to capture the client's mission and deliver a product with clear, concise, and robust code.

        When I work with a team my role is best described as a "glue" guy. 
        I like to keep morale and productivity high by looking at the bright side of things to keep the team together. 
        Communication is very important to me and I believe it is the cornerstone for any successful project. 
        I value high spirits during the development process as it always seems help create a better product.

        The bottom line is I love to solve problems. 
        I live for those "Aha!" breakthrough moments! 
        I like working on back-end development figuring out the underlying connections and intricacies in each application I build.
        Working on front-end development, putting on the "makeup", and creating responsive web design is a joy. 
        I like working with different types of people. 
        I believe this passion during the development process can be felt by the people around me, 
        and creates a product that exceeds expectations.
